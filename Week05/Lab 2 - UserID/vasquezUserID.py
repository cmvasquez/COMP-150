'''Write a function that prompts the user for the first and
last name and returns both to the main function. Write another
function that takes first and last name as parameters, extracts
the first (1) character of the first name and first 6 characters
of the last name, or the entire length if less than 6, to create
and return the userId â€“ all in lowercase regardless of input.
Write a main function to invoke the functions above and print
out the first and last name and the userId (in lowercase).
Your program will work for any string length.
